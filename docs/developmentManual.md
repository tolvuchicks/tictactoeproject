## Design report
The game TicTacToe will be implemented in this project. This is a simple console project. As a player you need to run the project to play the game. The game is for two players, one is using X and the other one O. Test driven development will be used in the coding process. Since the group consists of four people it was desided to always work on the project together at school. Each team member will be working in their local server using branches and pull requests. A branch will be made for each functionality and named accordingly.

This is a small project so it will only contain three classes. Below is the class diagram.
